# [Athena](https://github.com/athena-team/athena)

*Athena* is an open-source implementation of end-to-end speech processing engine. Our vision is to empower both industrial application and academic research on end-to-end models for speech processing. To make speech processing available to everyone, we're also releasing example implementation and recipe on some opensource dataset for various tasks (Automatic Speech Recognition, Speech Synthesis, Voice Conversion, Speaker Recognition, etc).

All of our models are implemented in Tensorflow>=2.0.1. For ease of use, we provide Kaldi-free pythonic feature extractor with [Athena_transform](https://github.com/athena-team/athena-transform).

# we highly recommend firstly update pip
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install tensorflow==2.0.1
```

### 3.3) Install *sph2pipe*, *spm*, *kenlm*, *sclite* for ASR Tasks [Optional]

These packages are usually required for ASR tasks, we assume they have been installed when running the recipe for ASR tasks. You can find installation scripts of them in `tools/`.

### 3.4) Install *horovod* for multiple-device training [Optional]

For multiple GPU/CPU training
You have to install the *horovod*, you can find out more information from the [horovod website](https://github.com/horovod/horovod#install).

### 3.5) Install *pydecoder* for WFST decoding [Optional]

For WFST decoding
You have to install *pydecoder*, installation guide for *pydecoder* can be found [athena-decoder website](https://github.com/athena-team/athena-decoder#installation)

### 3.6) Install *athena* package

```bash
git clone https://github.com/athena-team/athena.git
cd athena
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py bdist_wheel sdist
python -m pip install --ignore-installed dist/athena-0.1.0*.whl
```

- Once athena is successfully installed, you should do `source tools/env.sh` firstly before doing other things.
- For installing some other supporting tools, you can check the `tools/install*.sh` to install kenlm, sph2pipe, spm and ... [Optional]

### 3.7) Test your installation

- On a single cpu/gpu

```bash
source tools/env.sh
python examples/translate/spa-eng-example/prepare_data.py examples/translate/spa-eng-example/data/train.csv
python athena/main.py examples/translate/spa-eng-example/transformer.json
```

- On multiple cpu/gpu in one machine (you should make sure your hovorod is successfully installed)

```bash
source tools/env.sh
python examples/translate/spa-eng-example/prepare_data.py examples/translate/spa-eng-example/data/train.csv
horovodrun -np 4 -H localhost:4 athena/horovod_main.py examples/translate/spa-eng-example/transformer.json
```

### Notes

- If you see errors such as `ERROR: Cannot uninstall 'wrapt'` while installing TensorFlow, try updating it using command `conda update wrapt`. Same for similar dependencies such as `entrypoints`, `llvmlite` and so on.
- You may want to make sure you have `g++` version 7 or above to make sure you can successfully install TensorFlow.

## 4) Training
We will use ASR task TIMIT as an example to walk you through the whole training process. The recipe for this tutorial can be found at ```examples/asr/timit/run_101.sh```.

### 4.1) Prepare the data
The data for TIMIT can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/mfekadu/darpa-timit-acousticphonetic-continuous-speech) or [here](https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/10256148). First, we need to download the data and place it at ```examples/asr/timit/data/TIMIT```.
Then we will run the following scripts, which will do some data precessing and generate data csv for train, dev and test set of TIMIT.
```
mkdir -p examples/asr/timit/data
python examples/asr/timit/local/prepare_data.py examples/asr/timit/data/TIMIT examples/asr/timit/data
```
Below is an example csv we generated, it contains the absolute path of input audio, its length, its transcript and its speaker
```csv
wav_filename	wav_length_ms	transcript	speaker
/workspace/athena/examples/asr/timit/data/wav/TRAIN/MCLM0-SI1456.WAV	3065	sil dh iy z eh er er vcl g ae sh vcl b ah vcl b ax sh epi m ey cl k hh ay l ix f ah ng cl sh epi en el th er m el vcl b eh r ix er z sil	MCLM0

### 4.2) Setting the Configuration File

All of our training/ inference configurations are written in config.json. Below is an example configuration file with comments to help you understand.

```jsonc
{
  "batch_size":16,
  "num_epochs":20,
  "sorta_epoch":1,  # keep batches sorted for sorta_epoch, this helps with the convergence of models

  "num_classes": null,
  "pretrained_model": null,
  "model_config":{
    "model":"speech_transformer",
    "model_config":{
      "return_encoder_output":true,  # whether to return encoder only or encoder + decoder
      "num_filters":256,  # dimension of cnn filter
      "d_model":256,  # dimension of transformer
      "num_heads":8,  # heads of transformer

    "d_model":256,
    "warmup_steps":4000,
    "k":1
  },


  "dataset_builder": "speech_recognition_dataset",
  "num_data_threads": 1,
  "trainset_config":{
    "data_csv": "examples/asr/timit/data/train.csv",
    "audio_config":{"type":"Fbank", "filterbank_channel_count":40},  # config for feature extraction
    "cmvn_file":"examples/asr/timit/data/cmvn",  # mean and variance of FBank
    "text_config": {"type":"eng_vocab", "model":"examples/asr/timit/data/vocab"},  # vocab list
    "speed_permutation": [0.9, 1.0, 1.1],  # use speed perturbation to increase data diversitty
    "input_length_range":[10, 8000]  # range of audio input length
  },

    "audio_config":{"type":"Fbank", "filterbank_channel_count":40},
    "cmvn_file":"examples/asr/timit/data/cmvn",
    "text_config": {"type":"eng_vocab", "model":"examples/asr/timit/data/vocab"}
  }
}
```

To get state-of-the-art models, we usually need to train for more epochs and use ctc joint decoding with language model. These are omitted for to make this tutorial easier to understand.

### 4.3) Data normalization
Data normalization is important for the convergence of neural network models. With the generated csv file, we will compute the cmvn file like this
```
python athena/cmvn_main.py examples/asr/$dataset_name/configs/mpc.json examples/asr/$dataset_name/data/all.csv
```
The generated cmvn files will be found at ```examples/asr/timit/data/cmvn```.

### 4.4) Train a Model

With all the above preparation done, training becomes straight-forward. `athena/main.py` is the entry point of the training module. Just run:
```
$ python athena/main.py examples/asr/timit/configs/mtl_transformer_sp_101.json
```

Please install Horovod and MPI at first, if you want to train model using multi-gpu. See the [Horovod page](https://github.com/horovod/horovod) for more instructions.

To run on a machine with 4 GPUs with Athena:
```
$ horovodrun -np 4 -H localhost:4 python athena/horovod_main.py examples/asr/timit/configs/mtl_transformer_sp_101.json
```

To run on 4 machines with 4 GPUs each with Athena:
```
$ horovodrun -np 16 -H server1:4,server2:4,server3:4,server4:4 python athena/horovod_main.py examples/asr/timit/configs/mtl_transformer_sp_101.json
```

### 4.5) Evaluate a model
All of our inference related scripts are merged into inference.py. `athena/inference.py` is the entry point of inference. Just run:
```
python athena/inference.py examples/asr/timit/configs/mtl_transformer_sp_101.json
```
A file named `inference.log` will be generated, which contains the log of decoding. `inference.log` is very important to get correct scoring results, and it will be overwrited if you run `athena/inference.py` multiple times.

### 4.6) Scoring
For scoring, you will need to install [sclite](https://github.com/usnistgov/SCTK) first. The results of scoring can be found in `score/score_map/inference.log.result.map.sys`. The last few lines will look like this
```
|================================================================|
| Sum/Avg|  192   7215 | 84.4   11.4    4.3    3.2   18.8   99.5 |
|================================================================|
|  Mean  |  1.0   37.6 | 84.7   11.4    3.9    3.3   18.6   99.5 |
|  S.D.  |  0.0   11.7 |  7.7    6.3    4.2    3.6    9.0    7.2 |
| Median |  1.0   36.0 | 85.0   10.8    2.9    2.8   17.5  100.0 |
|----------------------------------------------------------------|
```
The line with ```Sum/Avg``` is usually what you should be looking for if you just want an overall PER result. In this case, 11.4 is the substitution error, 4.3 is the deletion error, 3.2 is the insertion error and 18.8 is the total PER.

## 5) Decoding with WFST
In Athena, we also provide functionalities for WFST graph creation and WFST based decoding with seq2seq models. To use it, you need to install [athena-decoder](https://github.com/athena-team/athena-decoder) first.

### 5.1) WFST graph creation
The graph creation scripts for HKUST and AISHELL can be found in the [build graph section](https://github.com/athena-team/athena-decoder#build-graph) of athena-decoder. We support the creation of TLG.fst (for ctc decoding) and LG.fst (for seq2seq model decoding). To build the graph, you need to provide lexicon and vocab of the target dataset.

The graph creation follows the standard procedure of compose -> determinize -> minimize -> arcsort -> remove_disambig. In athena-decoeder, the whole procedure is written in python to make users easier to understand and debug.

### 5.2) WFST decoding
Once we finished graph creation, the decoding becomes straightforward. We just need to decode with a new json file. Usually the new json file ends with _wfst. The items related to WFST decoding are (taken from ```examples/asr/aishell/configs/mtl_transformer_sp_wfst.json```):
```jsonc
"inference_config":{
    "decoder_type":"wfst_decoder",  # note its different from beam_search_decoder we usually use
    "wfst_graph":"examples/asr/aishell/data/LG.fst",  # path for wfst graph
    "acoustic_scale":10.0,  # scale of acoustic score and language model score
    "max_active":100,  # max active tokens kept alive before path expanding
    "min_active":0,  # min active tokens kept alive before path expanding
    "wfst_beam":100.0,  # a constant to balance the score of beam_cutoff
    "max_seq_len":100  # max length of output seq
  },
```

Our WFST decoding follows similiar procedure as Kaldi and is composed of four major steps: init_decoding, process_emitting, process_nonemitting and get_best_path. For more detail, please checkout [code](https://github.com/athena-team/athena-decoder/blob/master/pydecoders/decoders/wfst_decoder.py) here.

Take AISHELL as an example, with WFST decoding, the command to run becomes ```python athena/inference.py examples/asr/aishell/configs/mtl_transformer_sp_wfst.json```. Some results with AISHELL are listed below:
Decoder  | CTC Joint Decoding |  Error Rate (CER)
:-----------: | :------------: | -------:
Beam Search  | No | 7.98%
Beam Search  | Yes | 6.82%  |
WFST  | No |  7.21% ** |

Note that beam search without CTC Joint Decoding is considerably worse. But WFST without CTC Joint decoding gives better results than beam search.

** The result using WFST mainly because of using larger beam size

## 6) Deployment
After training, you can deploy ASR and TTS models on servers using the TensorFlow C++ API. As an example, below are some steps to achieve this functionality with an ASR model.

1. Install all dependencies, including TensorFlow, Protobuf, absl, Eigen3 and kenlm (optional).
2. Freeze the model to pb format with `athena/deploy_main.py`.
3. Compile the C++ codes.
4. Load the model and do argmax decoding in C++ codes, see `deploy/src/asr.cpp` for the entry point.

After compiling, an executable file will be generated and you can run the executable file:
```
$ ./asr
```

Detailed implementation is described [here](deploy/README.md).
